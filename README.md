# OECD-Modelling
### 1. Have a look at the files and draw a logical data model
From the csv files I have made a general overview of these files and what they contains via an ERD model.
![ERD-model](32235484_10215375826410111_7038487813641207808_n.jpg)

As seen from the ERD model the attributes they contain are very much the same, so I made some tables from these entities attributes, as seen below:
![]()
